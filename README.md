# Fivem-first-LTD-texture-for-mp-male
This is my first texture on a shirt specifically built for fivem but however you able to put it into regular GTA as well. Look at the README for more info. 

This is my first texture, so it isn't really a whole lot but here it is. 

How to install this texture: 

Open, openiv (for those of you who don't have it, here's the link: https://openiv.com/) and go to mods/x64v/models/cdimages/streamedpeds_mp.rpf/mp_m_freemode_01 and scroll down till you see jbib_diff_009_j_uni.ytd. With edit mode on, click edit and then find where it says replace and select the png image attached in above. After that click save, and you're ready for single player! However, if you're placing it in fivem, then just copy the new-texture folder into your resources folder and then add ensure (or start if you prefer) to your server.cfg and start your fivem server! 

Disclaimer: do NOT start this resource by itself! It will not work! Tested and won't work under ANY conditions!
